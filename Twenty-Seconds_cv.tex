\begin{twenty}
  \twentyitem
    {2016-present}
    {Freelance Full Stack Web Developer}
    {}
    {Improved websites for businesses. My work involved frontend, backend and aspects of deployment.}
  \twentyitem
    {2014-2016}
    {Postgraduate Researcher}
    {Glasgow}
    {Continued to advance my programming expertise through exotic particle physics and mentoring of undergraduates.  The research concerned the  statistical significance of hypothesised high mass resonances decaying to a Vector boson and Higgs boson.}
\twentyitem
    {2013-2014}
    {Postgraduate Researcher}
    {Hamburg}
    {Gained valuable experience of software development through the prism of detector physics.  The goal of this research was to  characterise silicon micrometre strip sensor designed for high precision tracking of charged high energy particles.}
